## Try it

```sh
cargo run --release -p viamind          # opens a new design and serves it to agents
claude mcp add --transport http viamind http://127.0.0.1:7878/mcp
```

Ask your agent to place parts (`add_part`, `move_part`, `delete_part`); they appear live in the window.
Undo anything with Ctrl+Z or the Edit menu; agents undo their own changes with the `undo` tool.
`viamind --demo` opens the synthetic 10k-object test scene, and `VIAMIND_MCP_PORT` changes the port.
